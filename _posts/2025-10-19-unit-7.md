In the second collaborative discussion I was supposed to analyse the moral dillema of research scientist Abi and highlight ethical, legal and moral aspects of this situation.

## Whizz case study

Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.

Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”

Ethical Concerns

Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?
Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?
Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?
If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?
You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses.

## Initial post
Before reading Correa (Corrêa et al., 2023) I would not have imagined how many ethical principles can be violated in the situation which is trivial at the first glance. Indeed, there are different statistical procedures, and some can represent the findings in favorable ways. The ability and the determination of the reader to be able to assess the appropriateness of methods applied is rather a high expectation. This is why the principles that Correa (2023) published are so important. Deciding whether and how to report potentially dangerous substances in Whizz cereals is an important decision that may have a very unpleasant consequence. While the principles Correa explains are valid, the paper calls for AI ethics. However, Abi works at research institute so as a researcher when it comes to statistics there are already malpractices like cherry picking - without AI included. For sure when it comes to food industry there is an FDA (food and drug administration) which should ideally disapprove the use of harmful nutrients after checking the robustness of statistical methods used and the findings. So the Whizz cereals might not be approved and depending on ingredients– they might as well get banned by FDA like harmful dyes (Newgen, 2025).

Answering the ethical question, here are the principles Abi can potentially violate based on his decision: truthfulness and trustworthiness (in case he presents results in more favorable light), transparency and fairness (potentially if he chooses one statistical method over another to manipulate results), accountability, justice, and beneficence (in case of harm to public health and especially vulnerable groups). While Abi can’t bare the responsibility of what the manufacturer reports he is responsible for what he reports and indeed this can affect his professional stand and career going forward.

## Peer response to my post by Lucas Bennion
Hi Victoria, 

Your post offers a thoughtful and practical reflection on how easily ethical principles can be compromised through statistical manipulation, even in seemingly minor research contexts. I agree with your point that truthfulness, transparency, and accountability are particularly vulnerable when data are selectively presented to produce favourable results. Corrêa et al. (2023) emphasise that ethical governance must apply consistently across all domains, not just within AI, and your example of the Whizz cereals scenario illustrates how statistical choices can have real public-health implications.

I also appreciate your observation that misconduct such as cherry-picking predates AI. As Ioannidis (2005) argued, biased statistical reporting can distort scientific credibility long before automation enters the process. What AI introduces, however, is scale and speed - errors or biases can now propagate far more widely. Your link to FDA oversight is well placed, as regulatory scrutiny remains one of the few mechanisms capable of deterring unethical data use in industries where profit pressures are high (Floridi and Cowls, 2021).

Overall, your discussion effectively ties ethical theory to applied research practice, highlighting the shared professional responsibility to protect integrity regardless of technological context.

## My summary post 
While looking at Abi’s case I used to think of it as isolated incident and argued that AI ethics is not applicable to Abi since he has a role of research scientist and at any university misrepresentation of research findings is a malpractice with or without AI. What Lucas highlighted is that with AI the scale of harm can be easily intensified. I tend to agree. If I consider current level of using AI for cooking, meal planning, grocery shopping and robotic chefs (Gupta, 2024) the potential harm magnifies. For example, nutrition apps and automated recommendations for children’s breakfast that are based on information about ingredients would lead to unwanted consequences. Since the dependence of AI is growing for meal planning, groceries shopping, using robots for cooking and using smart kitchens application - the food choices can be easily influenced. With the trust to technology the potential misinformation represented by Abi can affect vulnerable population with certain health conditions severely. This is the reason why ethical governance described by Correa (Corrêa et al., 2023) is crucial to ensure safety of public health by applying principles of truthfulness, transparency, and accountability.

## Here is the initial post of my peer Fiqki.
The case of Abi raises fundamental ethical questions about integrity in data analysis and reporting. While altering data values would clearly constitute falsification, selectively performing analyses to present favourable outcomes also risks misleading stakeholders. According to the ACM Code of Ethics, computing professionals must “avoid harm” and ensure honesty in all professional work (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). Similarly, the BCS Code of Conduct emphasises transparency and accountability, requiring members to provide accurate and unbiased information (British Computer Society, 2022).

From an ethical standpoint, presenting only positive correlations violates principles of honesty and informed decision-making. Legally, misrepresentation of research findings can amount to fraud or breach of contract, particularly if the manufacturer uses these results for marketing claims (Office of Research Integrity, 2017). Under frameworks such as GDPR and consumer protection laws, inaccurate reporting may expose both Abi and his organisation to liability.

Socially, such practices erode public trust in scientific research and can have health implications if harmful products are promoted as nutritious. Professionally, statistical programmers have a duty to uphold rigorous standards, resisting organisational pressure to manipulate outcomes (Duquenoy, 2019). Abi’s most ethical course of action is to report accurate findings, accompanied by clear documentation of methodology, and to disclose any limitations transparently. If the manufacturer chooses selective publication, Abi should consider escalation through institutional ethics committees or whistleblowing channels.

## This is my peer response to my peer Fiqki. 
Hi Fiqki,

Thanks a lot for your post. All points are valid and excellent, and I tend to agree. While ACM offers guidelines, I feel like American Statistical Association (ASA) Ethical Guidelines are more appropriate since they are designed for researchers dealing with scientific data versus IT professionals. In section A Professional Integrity and accountability it is written that professional “Opposes efforts to predetermine or influence the results of statistical practices and resists pressure to selectively interpret data” (American Statistical Association, 2022) Which makes me think that such cases are rather common if this was addressed and recorded. Also, to your point of misleading stakeholders it is said that interests of stakeholders should be respected and that practitioner “regardless of personal or institutional interests or external pressures, does not use statistical practices to mislead any stakeholder”. I also agree that Abi should consider escalation however it is possible that there is an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) in place when it comes to recipe and ingredients. What I found in ASA is that professionals should “lodge complaints of misconduct discreetly and to the relevant institutional body” (American Statistical Association, 2022). We do not know whether at the institution where Abi works there is ethics committee, but I think now we see that misconduct could be a case but as of now it is not. Once it happens Abi should surely escalate.
Here is my summary post:

## Initial post of my peer David Wang
The case of Abi, the researcher analyzing the nutritional value of Whizzz cereal, raises important ethical questions about accuracy, integrity, and professional responsibility in data analysis. According to the ACM Code of Ethics (2018), computing professionals must be honest and trustworthy, avoiding deceptive or misleading representations of data. Although Abi might be tempted to highlight only the favorable correlations, doing so would compromise the integrity of the analysis and violate the ethical principle of honesty. Presenting selective results, even when the data itself is not altered, can still mislead stakeholders and distort public understanding of scientific findings.

From a legal standpoint, publishing misleading nutritional claims could violate consumer protection laws and food labeling regulations, such as those enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.K. Food Standards Agency. If Abi knowingly facilitates the release of biased results, he could be implicated in fraudulent or negligent conduct. The British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct (2021) reinforces the duty to maintain accuracy and avoid actions that could harm the public interest.

Socially, such behavior erodes trust in scientific research and data professionals. Ethically, Abi should disclose both positive and negative results, ensuring transparency and providing appropriate context in his reporting. Professionally, he has a duty to communicate findings responsibly and, if necessary, refuse to participate in any effort to misrepresent data. Upholding accuracy and transparency protects both public welfare and the credibility of the profession.

## My peer response to David Wang
Hi David, thanks for sharing your thoughts!

Misconduct can lead to massive misinformation of the public. Like the false claim that vaccines causes autism – the doubt can remain forever despite being rebuked (Hartmann, 2025). From the legal standpoint apart from food labeling regulations and consumer protection laws in USA there is also FDA (food and drug administration) that bans harmful ingredients and should not approve the recipe for Whizzz cereal (Newgen, 2025) given it is to be sold in USA.

Indeed Abi’s own professional career can suffer if he misrepresents information cause doing so will violate many ethical principles like trustworthy, transparency, accountability, fairness, beneficence according to Correa (Corrêa et al., 2023) along with integrity of data and methods, professional accountability, responsibility to stakeholders and those affection by statistical Practice according to American Statistical Association (ASA) Ethical guidelines (American Statistical Association, 2022). So the disadvantages for Abi when it comes to data manipulation significantly outweigh all possible advantages of stay professional, ethical and within legal framework.
