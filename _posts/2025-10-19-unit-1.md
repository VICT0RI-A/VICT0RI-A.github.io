## Case study
For the first collaborative discussion I chose case study about Malicious Inputs to Content Filters. The full description can be found here https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies/malicious-inputs-to-content-filters. Here is a quick summary. 

The US Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) mandates that public schools and libraries employ mechanisms to block inappropriate matter on the grounds that it is deemed harmful to minors. Blocker Plus is an automated Internet content filter designed to help these institutions comply with CIPA’s requirements. During a review session, the development team reviewed a number of complaints about content being blocked inappropriately.

My task was to compare the ACM analysis with the British Computer Science (BCS) code of conduct and here is my initial post. 

Then I responded to my peer Lucas who chose Case study "Dark UX Patterns" which could be found here https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/case-studies/dark-ux-patterns. 
The change request Stewart received was simple: replace the website’s rounded rectangle buttons with arrows, and adjust the color palette to one that mixes red and green text. But he found the prototype confusing. He suggested to his manager that this design would probably trick users into more expensive options they didn’t want. The response was that these were the changes requested by the client.

Below is my response:

Hi Louis,
Thanks a lot for picking this study. When we got this assignment, I was so blown away by examples that I struggled with the choice. Thanks to you I have a chance to ponder on this case a bit more. If you think about it – intentional dark patterns are very common. When I go to the restaurant it is oftentimes the information about 10% tips that is written in such a small font that it is impossible to read. Thinking of Amazon being sued by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for using “deceptive and manipulative tactics to trick users into enrolling in (prime membership)”  (“FTC v. Amazon: Prime Cancellation Case Goes to Trial Over Alleged ‘Dark Patterns,’” 2025). It is hard to believe that one of the most successful companies could engage in “Roach Motel” pattern (Gray et al., 2018) where it is easy to get into prime subscription and very difficult to get out of it.  Another notorious company for deceptive patterns use is Ryanair. Starting with concealing “opt out for travel insurance” forcing customers to purchase it, confusing text for opting out from subscription list, which is ticked by default, or “clicking continue triggering automatic consent” are just a few examples (Dark Patterns, n.d.) “Bait and Switch” is just one of the types of dark pattern that Ryanair uses (Gray et al., 2018). Both companies violate BCS principles of professional competence and integrity and public interest (“BCS Code of Conduct,” n.d.).
