## Initial Post
In the unit 7 I was supposed to analyse the moral dillema of research scientist Abi and highlight ethical, legal and moral aspects of this situation.

## Here is Abi's situation

## This is my initial post
## Here is the initial post of my peer Fiqki.
The case of Abi raises fundamental ethical questions about integrity in data analysis and reporting. While altering data values would clearly constitute falsification, selectively performing analyses to present favourable outcomes also risks misleading stakeholders. According to the ACM Code of Ethics, computing professionals must “avoid harm” and ensure honesty in all professional work (Association for Computing Machinery, 2018). Similarly, the BCS Code of Conduct emphasises transparency and accountability, requiring members to provide accurate and unbiased information (British Computer Society, 2022).

From an ethical standpoint, presenting only positive correlations violates principles of honesty and informed decision-making. Legally, misrepresentation of research findings can amount to fraud or breach of contract, particularly if the manufacturer uses these results for marketing claims (Office of Research Integrity, 2017). Under frameworks such as GDPR and consumer protection laws, inaccurate reporting may expose both Abi and his organisation to liability.

Socially, such practices erode public trust in scientific research and can have health implications if harmful products are promoted as nutritious. Professionally, statistical programmers have a duty to uphold rigorous standards, resisting organisational pressure to manipulate outcomes (Duquenoy, 2019). Abi’s most ethical course of action is to report accurate findings, accompanied by clear documentation of methodology, and to disclose any limitations transparently. If the manufacturer chooses selective publication, Abi should consider escalation through institutional ethics committees or whistleblowing channels.

Hi Fiqki,

Thanks a lot for your post. All points are valid and excellent, and I tend to agree. While ACM offers guidelines, I feel like American Statistical Association (ASA) Ethical Guidelines are more appropriate since they are designed for researchers dealing with scientific data versus IT professionals. In section A Professional Integrity and accountability it is written that professional “Opposes efforts to predetermine or influence the results of statistical practices and resists pressure to selectively interpret data” (American Statistical Association, 2022) Which makes me think that such cases are rather common if this was addressed and recorded. Also, to your point of misleading stakeholders it is said that interests of stakeholders should be respected and that practitioner “regardless of personal or institutional interests or external pressures, does not use statistical practices to mislead any stakeholder”. I also agree that Abi should consider escalation however it is possible that there is an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) in place when it comes to recipe and ingredients. What I found in ASA is that professionals should “lodge complaints of misconduct discreetly and to the relevant institutional body” (American Statistical Association, 2022). We do not know whether at the institution where Abi works there is ethics committee, but I think now we see that misconduct could be a case but as of now it is not. Once it happens Abi should surely escalate.
Here is my summary post:
While looking at Abi’s case I used to think of it as isolated incident and argued that AI ethics is not applicable to Abi since he has a role of research scientist and at any university misrepresentation of research findings is a malpractice with or without AI. What Lucas highlighted is that with AI the scale of harm can be easily intensified. I tend to agree. If I consider current level of using AI for cooking, meal planning, grocery shopping and robotic chefs (Gupta, 2024) the potential harm magnifies. For example, nutrition apps and automated recommendations for children’s breakfast that are based on information about ingredients would lead to unwanted consequences. Since the dependence of AI is growing for meal planning, groceries shopping, using robots for cooking and using smart kitchens application - the food choices can be easily influenced. With the trust to technology the potential misinformation represented by Abi can affect vulnerable population with certain health conditions severely. This is the reason why ethical governance described by Correa (Corrêa et al., 2023) is crucial to ensure safety of public health by applying principles of truthfulness, transparency, and accountability.

Hi David, thanks for sharing your thoughts!

Misconduct can lead to massive misinformation of the public. Like the false claim that vaccines causes autism – the doubt can remain forever despite being rebuked (Hartmann, 2025). From the legal standpoint apart from food labeling regulations and consumer protection laws in USA there is also FDA (food and drug administration) that bans harmful ingredients and should not approve the recipe for Whizzz cereal (Newgen, 2025) given it is to be sold in USA.

Indeed Abi’s own professional career can suffer if he misrepresents information cause doing so will violate many ethical principles like trustworthy, transparency, accountability, fairness, beneficence according to Correa (Corrêa et al., 2023) along with integrity of data and methods, professional accountability, responsibility to stakeholders and those affection by statistical Practice according to American Statistical Association (ASA) Ethical guidelines (American Statistical Association, 2022). So the disadvantages for Abi when it comes to data manipulation significantly outweigh all possible advantages of stay professional, ethical and within legal framework.
